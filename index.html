        Hi, my name is Arron Diu. I'm a Vietnamese-American; my family and I moved to the United States in 2016.
        After 5 years living in the U.S. I was able to take the citizenship test, and ligally became an American.
        Currently, I live in city of Rosemead, Los Angeles county, CA. I love my hometown because people here are nice and 
        warm. As a Vietnamese-American, this is one of the best cities for me to live. It is one of the biggest Asian
        communites in the United States. Therefore, I do not feel different when living here; that gives me the confidence 
        that I need. However, I might move in a near future, to a place that is closer to the University that I'm trying 
        to transfer to. Currently, I have two part-time jobs, one as a cashier, and the other one as a food delivery driver. 
        I need to work hard so that I can afford for my educational plans, and support my family. Since I have two jobs
        at the same time, I rarely have free time. When I do, I usually travel or play games such as
        <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" class="lol" target="_blank">League of Legends</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/" class="cod" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>. I have a dream of 
        working at Riot Games or Activation because I enjoy playing games and I'm have been working to become a game developer.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p class="par">
        I attented East Los Angeles College in Fall 2018 as a Computer-Science-major student and I spent the first two 
        years only for studying general classes. Starting in 2020, I began to take my major classes in Computer Science.
        Unfortunately, the Codvid-19 pandemic began, I had to take online classes; I have not been to the campus since 
        the pandemic. However, learning online is not really a big problem for Computer Science students. It is an 
        interesting major for me. I have learnt many coding languages recentlly such as C++, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS 
        and now I'm able to build my Portfolio website. I'm currently trying to transfer to Calpoly Pomona in Fall 2022. 
        I have a quite good G.P.A.; hope I am going to be accepted. With all the skills I have been learning and improving,
        I also hope I will be offered for an internship in Summer, and Spring 2022.
